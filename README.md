# emoji-meaning-app

The Emoji Meaning app, tells you the meaning of different emoticons from it's database. 

The program is built using React-JS, HTML and CSS. 
I created this project over CodeSandBox, It's a great online IDE that you must check out.

This is my first react project.

I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
